1. Overview
The Samsung FRP Bypass Tool is a Windows-based utility designed to remove Factory Reset Protection (FRP) from Samsung devices running Android 15 and 16.
Unlike traditional methods that require complex manual inputs or paid server credits, this tool utilizes a local modem exploit to force-enable USB Debugging (ADB). Once ADB is active, the tool automatically removes the Google Account lock.
2. How the Exploit Works (The "Secret Door")
This tool ignores the locked Android Operating System ("Front Door") and communicates directly with the device's hardware modem ("Side Door").
The Process
 * The Entry: The tool scans for the Samsung Modem Port (not the standard ADB interface).
 * The Distraction: It sends a sequence of proprietary AT Commands (factory test codes) to the modem.
   * AT+DUMPCTRL=1,0: Prepares the system for a state change.
   * AT+SWATD=0: Disables the hardware Watchdog timer.
 * The Trigger: It forces the internal Debug Level to "High."
 * The Popup: When the Watchdog timer is re-enabled (AT+SWATD=1), the USB controller resets. Because the Debug Level is now High, the Android OS defaults to showing the "Allow USB Debugging" popup on the screen.
 * The Unlock: Once the user clicks "Allow," the tool uses standard ADB commands to delete the com.google.android.gsf package (Google Services Framework), effectively removing the lock.
3. Developer Guide: How to Build in Visual Studio 2025
Prerequisites
 * IDE: Microsoft Visual Studio 2025 (or 2019/2022).
 * Framework: .NET Framework 4.7.2.
 * External Files: ADB Platform Tools (adb.exe, AdbWinApi.dll, AdbWinUsbApi.dll).
Step-by-Step Setup
 * Create Project:
   * Open Visual Studio.
   * Select "Create a new project".
   * Search for "Windows Forms App (.NET Framework)".
   * Name the project: SamsungFRPTool.
 * Add References:
   * Go to Solution Explorer > Right-click References > Add Reference...
   * Search for and check: System.Management.
   * Click OK.
 * Add the Code:
   * Open Form1.cs.
   * Delete all existing code.
   * Paste the Full Source Code provided in the previous steps.
 * Clean Up:
   * Delete Program.cs from Solution Explorer (to prevent "multiple entry points" error).
 * Add ADB Files (CRITICAL):
   * Navigate to your project folder: bin\Debug.
   * Paste adb.exe, AdbWinApi.dll, and AdbWinUsbApi.dll into this folder.
   * Note: Without these files, the "Unlock" button will fail.
